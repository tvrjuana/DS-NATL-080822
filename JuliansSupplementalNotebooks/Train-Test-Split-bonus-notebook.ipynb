    "![Clearly linear scatterplot](./justdot.png)\n",

    "### The options to input into train_test_split:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### arrays\n",
    "First, we MUST pass in arrays. They must be \"sequence of indexables with same length / shape\" That is, the same number of rows, and those rows must match up. So row 1 in one array needs to map to row 1 in the second array.  In this case, our X variables or predictors, and our Y variables or target. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### test_size\n",
    "Next, we can choose the test_size. We can set this manually, or use the default. The default is .25, or 25% of the data. If we pass an int it will set the size of the test size to that int, if we pass a value between 1 and 0 it makes the test dataset a corresponding % of the overall dataset. The default here is fine for most use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### train_size\n",
    "Or we can set the training size instead of the test size. But usually we want to use all the data we don't put into the test set, so by default we leave this untouched.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### random_state\n",
    "So, we want our tts to be randomized, otherwise we'll bias the samples and blahblahblah. Buuuuut we want to be able to open and close the notebook and have our results be repeatable. So here we usually want to pass in some arbitary random seed, so that each time the TTS is run *on the same dataset* you end up with the same random result. best practice is to pick a number and stick with it. Because programmers are nerds, 42 is a fairly widely used arbitrary seed. I do 14 because that's my lucky number. You can do whatever, it just forces the split to be the same each time you run it.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### shuffle \n",
    "Shuffle is a boolean option that defaults to true. Basically it makes sure that you're actually grabbing data points randomly, which we almost always want to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### stratify\n",
    "You can pass in an array to have the split try to ensure that it balances the split based on the contents of that array. Usually we don't do this, and if we do, usually we stratify by the target. \n",
    "\n",
    "For an example of when we might use this, if we have a classification dataset that has some very rare values in the target, we might want to force the t-t-s to try to make sure there's an equal proportion of each possible target in the train and the test. This is a problem that goes away with bigger datasets thanks to the Law of Large Numbers."
